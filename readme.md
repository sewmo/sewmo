# Hello, I'm Sewmo ✌️
## About:
I am a 14 year old from Romania with a heavy interest in low level programming, networking, and embedded systems.  
Currently building beginner-intermediate level projects. I try to refrain from utilizing AI in my projects in order to learn the underlying skills in programming.
